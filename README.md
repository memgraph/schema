# schema

The goal here is to define a schema standard that would be returned for a given graph by running a query like `SHOW SCHEMA INFO;`. The first few versions of the standard aim to focus on getting the statistical data about the schemaless label-property graphs. Over the long run, the goal is to incorporate the full definition of any schema the user defines.

The standard should be the basis for building many different applications leveraging the specification. Examples of such applications are:
* graph schema visualizers
* graph query language code completion
* tools to assist with schema changes by estimating the implications
* LLM and, in general, AI applications.

NOTE: `.json` examples are formatter using https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ (2 Space Tab).
